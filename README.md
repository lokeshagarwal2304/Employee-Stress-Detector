# Employee-Stress-Detector
Employee Stress Detection uses data processing steps like tokenization, splitting, and feature extraction to identify stress patterns. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib handle data and visualization, while ML models detect stress in real-time. This aids in promoting employee health and fostering a productive, supportive workplace.
